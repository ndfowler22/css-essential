        <h2>UI Artist</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Natalie Fowler and I am a 22 year old UI Artist. I grew up in a small town near Rocky Mount, North Carolina then moved to Raleigh at the age of 18. I grew up playing video games with my first console being a playstation 2. I continued to engage in video games as a grew up and ultimately decided to pursue something in the field. As such, I became a UI Artist to help in the creation of astounding images and 3D illustrations for numerous video games. </p>

          <h3>A first person shooter video game loading screen image</h3>
          <img src="images/fpspage.jpg" alt="a soldier in their gear golding an assault rifle with a smoky, burning city behind them">
          <p>We needed to create an image that would be used during a loading screen in a new first person shooter video game. We wanted the picture to display the chaos that players will endure as they play the game. We wanted the city to be engulfed in flames, but not too much where players feel hopeless in achieving the ultimate goal, relieving the city of the control of the enemies and rebuilding an environment for the citizens.</p>
